# Chada-Clock-Project

# Summarize the Project and what problem it was solving?
In project one we were working the Chada Tech Clock. The client wanted to be able to
view a 12 and 24 hour clock on their website. The 12 hour clock should be in 12-hour format
where the clock does not exceed 12:59:59. And the 24-hour clock was displayed in 24-hour
formation and does not exceed 23:59:59. Both clocks should display on the screen next to each
other and have a menu to be able to add one hour, and one minute, add one second or exit the
program.
# What did you do particularly well?
With this being the first project in this course, it took me some time to get started. I refered a lot back to my notes and researched online for other resources on topics covered or helpful explanations. I did a good job at spacing out my time working on the project, in order to not overwhelm myself. By doing that I was able to think clearly, stay organzied and successfully finish the project. 
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more
# efficient, secure, and so on?
Looking at my code overall I believe I executed the task at hand efficiently. I am sure I could work on things such as organization or adding in different comments for readability. Overall I don't believe I would change too much.
# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome
# this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
After finishing my code I had trouble getting it to run and this was due to a error code I kept recieving. Through further research online I found that adding _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS fixed my problem. This was because I kept recieving deprecation warnings that would not allow my code to run like it should have. Zybooks goes over important material, but for me personally it was not my favorite way to study/learn. I learned best from this course by finding youtube videos, online forums, and different articles. Lastly I learned best just from hopping in visual studio and being hands on, which is how I learn best. 
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I personally thought that all of the skills from this project were transferable to other projects or course work. Everything I learn I am trying my best to take that with me to the next step. My ultimate goal is to become a game developer, and all skills will be helpful to take with me for that I am sure. Loops for some reason was a hard topic for me and this class it started to click in my brain a bit more for me. While I was nervous to learn C++ as it has been the most challenging language for me so far, I believe it pushed me to understand what I struggled with more. 
# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
When it comes to anything I do I really double check over and over until I am sure I have it right. I use white space and comments. I think that really helped with making my code
readable and maintainable. I do think that I could use work on my comments but I still think I did a good job with them here on this project. Improving comments would help for when
I donâ€™t touch something for a period of time, and then later may have to go back and
revisit, or even pass on my work to others.
